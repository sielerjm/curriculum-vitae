  abstract = {A growing body of research has established that the microbiome can mediate the dynamics and functional capacities of diverse biological systems. Yet, we understand little about what governs the response of these microbial communities to host or environmental changes. Most efforts to model microbiomes focus on defining the relationships between the microbiome, host, and environmental features within a specified study system and therefore fail to capture those that may be evident across multiple systems. In parallel with these developments in microbiome research, computer scientists have developed a variety of machine learning tools that can identify subtle, but informative, patterns from complex data. Here, we recommend using deep transfer learning to resolve microbiome patterns that transcend study systems. By leveraging diverse public data sets in an unsupervised way, such models can learn contextual relationships between features and build on those patterns to perform subsequent tasks (e.g., classification) within specific biological contexts.},

  abstract = {Zebrafish are increasingly used to study how environmental exposures impact vertebrate gut microbes. However, we understand little about which microbial taxa are common to the zebrafish gut across studies and facilities. Here, we define the zebrafish core gut microbiome to resolve microbiota that are both relatively robust to study or facility effects and likely to drive proper microbiome assembly and functioning due to their conservation. To do so, we integrated publicly available gut microbiome 16S gene sequence data from eight studies into a phylogeny and identified monophyletic clades of gut bacteria that are unexpectedly prevalent across individuals. Doing so revealed 585 core clades of bacteria in the zebrafish gut, including clades within Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Cetobacterium, Shewanella, Chitinibacter, Fluviicola, Flectobacillus, and Paucibacter. We then applied linear regression to discern which of these core clades are sensitive to an array of different environmental exposures. We found that 200 core clades were insensitive to any exposure we assessed, while 134 core clades were sensitive to more than two exposures. Overall, our analysis defines the zebrafish core gut microbiome and its sensitivity to exposure, which helps future studies to assess the robustness of their results and prioritize taxa for empirical assessments of how gut microbiota mediate the effects of exposure on the zebrafish host.},
